      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        For context this was built for my design team <a href="https://www.ubcthunderbikes.com" target="_blank">UBC ThunderBikes</a>. The target of the design team is to build an electric motorcycle to race against other student teams.

        For our 2024 iteration I was tasked with creating a dashboard to display real time diagnostic information in addition to supplying the rider with all necessary information while racing. 

      </p>
      <h3>Part Selection</h3>
      <p>
        With the end goal of designing a custom PCB with board mounted switches to simplify assembly, I sought out a microcontroller. As the team has used STM32's for all previous projects and that was the tech stack I was familiar with, it was decided I would stick within the STM32 ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this was my first time writing anything similar to this, I wasnted to simplify the development as much as possible and leave room for optimizations later. And because it's easier to change the firmware than the hardware, I selected a display on the smaller size (3.5", 320x240) but still with a 24-bit parallel interface with the intention of only dealing with a single frame buffer which incorporates the entire screen. So, my requirements for selecting a microcontroller were that it must have enough storage to buffer 1 full screen of data, ideally in memory, not flash (for speed). Also trying to maximize use of the STM32's extensive HAL, I decided using the built in LCD-TFT controller would simplify the project not having to integrate another 3rd party library. So now we were looking at finding an STM32 with a lot of memory and support for the LTDC. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We selected LVGL as the graphics library for its extensive documentation and examples that showed similar applications to ours.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototype creation </h3>
      <p>
        Despite the end goal being a PCB, I wanted to ensure my tech stack of LVGL -> STM32 LTDC -> parallel display actually worked before I spent time and money desinging a PCB for this. THerefore I selected an STM32 with a nucleo development board (STM32F767ZI), I then found a small breakout module for the ribbon cable (pictured below) so I could do all the soldering myself.
      </p>
      <h3>Problems</h3>
        In the first prototype I soldered the ~30 or so wires from the display to the microcontroller.
