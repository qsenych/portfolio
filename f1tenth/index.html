      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        For an F1TENTH-style autonomous racing challenge, I worked in a team of 4 to develop a custom reactive control algorithm for a 1/10th-scale autonomous race car. The goal was to navigate a tight, walled track head-to-head against another car. Most other teams used some version of a disparity extension algorithm, however, our teamed developed a novel idea. In the final head-to-head tournament, our vehicle placed 2nd in the class, proving the novel algorithm was a solid fit, but disparity extension could be tuned to be better.
      </p>

      <h3>Hardware &amp; Software Stack</h3>
      <p>
        The car platform was built on a Traxxas RC chassis equipped with a 2D LiDAR sensor, VESC motor controller, and an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 running Ubuntu.  Development was done in C++ using the ROS 2 framework, with ROS RViz and custom debug tools for visualization and tuning.  My focus was entirely on the control algorithm, which handled real-time path planning and steering logic based on live sensor input.
      </p>

      <h3>Algorithm Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The algorithm is a reactive algorithm, meaning it rebuilt the car’s understanding of the track with every LiDAR scan. First, the lidar data is pre-processed, ensuring only no invalid values interfere with the algorithm. Then, an occupancy grid was generated.  To account for the vehicle’s width while driving, all cells in the occupancy grid determined to be "occupied" were expanded.  Each unoccupied cell was assigned a weight based on its distance from the nearest wall, with safer cells receiving lower weights. This biases the path towards the centre of the track. The lowest-weight reachable point within a forward range was then selected as the target point. Using an A* path planner, the car generated a path biased toward these lower-weight cells, encouraging safer and more central navigation.  As a failsafe, if no path could be found, the vehicle’s speed was set to zero and steering maintained its last valid value, with a killswitch thread allowing an instant stop when necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Challenges &amp; Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges was creatively combining different path planning concepts.  I took inspiration from RRT* but adapted the ideas to work in a fully reactive, low-latency loop.  Tuning the occupancy grid was another major hurdle, as inflation size, biasing, and handling of unknown cells had to be carefully balanced to avoid overly conservative or overly aggressive driving. High-speed performance revealed a “snaking” effect on straights, which I partially mitigated by adjusting A* weight biasing, though it was not fully resolved. I also attempted to address late obstacle avoidance by expanding the occupancy grid in the negative x direction, encouraging earlier turns but introducing trade-offs when cornering.
      </p>

      <h3>Results &amp; Learnings</h3>
      <p>
        The car achieved 2nd place in the class tournament, showing competitive lap speeds and reliable obstacle handling without relying on a pre-mapped track. The approach was strong in handling both static and moving obstacles in real time, even under noisy sensor conditions. However, the lack of a braking-distance model meant that at higher speeds, the car could outrun its own reaction time. The track-center weighting also conflicted with optimal racing lines, limiting maximum lap speed. In hindsight, I believe a well tuned simpler algorithm such as disparity extension has a faster cieling than this algorithm, however, this process pushed my skills in creative problem solving and novel algorithm development, pushing me to be a better engineer.
